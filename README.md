# 📊 Employee Engagement & Revenue Impact Analysis
**Predictive modeling in R to quantify the ROI of workforce morale**

## 🎯 Executive Summary
Identified a critical revenue leak in the **South Region** (3.0 engagement, 100% turnover) and built a regression model proving that employee engagement is the primary driver of sales performance.

## 🚀 Key Results
* **The ROI:** Every **1-point increase** in engagement predicts **+$2,230.30** in monthly sales per site.
* **Predictive Power:** Engagement alone explains **53%** of all sales variance ($R^2 = 0.53$).
* **Recovery Potential:** Improving the South Region to company averages would recover **~$8,900 per store/month**.



## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
* **Statistics:** Linear Regression, Correlation Analysis, Hypothesis Testing.
* **Data Engineering:** Data cleaning, outlier removal, and regional filtering in **R**.
* **Strategic Thinking:** Translating p-values into actionable business "Recovery Plans."

## 💡 Top Recommendations
1.  **Intervene in South Region:** Address the 100% turnover crisis to stabilize regional revenue.
2.  **KPI Shift:** Treat Engagement scores as a **Leading Indicator** for Sales revenue.
3.  **Target:** Aim for a 4-point engagement lift to achieve a near **$9k/month revenue boost** per site.
